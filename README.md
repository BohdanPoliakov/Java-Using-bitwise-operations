# Develop a program that does the following:
- Output information about the developer (student ID number, name, surname).
- Enter an integer of type n byte. 
- Outputs the message "result:".
- Outputs the number of ones in the binary notation of the number n. 
For example, if the number 7 was entered, the program must output 3.

# Special requirements for the program:
- Do not use the methods Integer.bitCount() and Integer.toBinaryString(). Use bitwise operations to solve the problem.
- Input errors are not allowed.
- Place a comment at the beginning of the program containing information about the program developer (student ID number, name, group number).
